# Machine-intelligent-Multimodal-Algebot-for-Intracavitary-Chemotherapy
This project implements a deep learning (DL)-based intelligent navigation framework designed for autonomous microrobot control under real-time medical imaging guidance. The system integrates advanced image segmentation, object detection, motion planning, and robot actuation into a closed-loop control pipeline capable of tracking and guiding microrobot swarms toward specific targets (e.g., tumors).
It supports two control configurations:
· Coil-based control – applied to micro-scale ex-vivo multimodal control demonstrations
· Robotic magnet system (RMS)-based control – applied to macro-scale in-vivo tumor navigation
